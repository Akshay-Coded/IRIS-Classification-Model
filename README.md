# Iris Data Analysis and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying the Iris dataset using various machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of three different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Visualization**: Generating histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots for better understanding of data distribution.
- **Model Training**: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and classification steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook iris-data-analysis-and-classification.ipynb
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Comparative analysis of different machine learning models.
- Visualization of decision boundaries.
- Insights into feature importance for classification.
